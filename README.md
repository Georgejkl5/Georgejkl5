### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ George Here

Prior to Le Wagon, I was working in a tech startup. Unfortunately, due to the lack of technical expertise and problem solving methodologies, the startup was not able to progress. Determined to not make the same mistakes, I joined Le Wagon data science track to acquire the skillsets of a data scientist. 

Learning to be a data scientist was one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made because it strongly aligns with my passion, purpose and my personality.  I discovered my passion for data analytics when I could see that I was able to solve not only complex problems but also problems on a much larger scale efficiently. Personality wise, I am known to be process-orientated, always looking out for ways to automate and optimize workflows, which encourages me to see problems from various perspectives and implement new solutions to test and learn from. My purpose is to use data and my skillsets to generate as much impact as possible for businesses and individuals.
